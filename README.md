# PredCMB
**PredCMB** (**Pred**iction of **c**hanges in **m**eta**b**olites from shotgun metagenome) is a tool that predicts changes in individual metabolites from shotgun metagenomic sequencing data utilizing microbial gene-metabolite interaction

- - -

# Requirments
1. R (version >= 4.0.2)
2. [DESeq2](https://github.com/mikelove/DESeq2) (version == 1.30)
3. [Piano ](https://github.com/varemo/piano) (version == 2.6.0)
4. Python (version >= 3.7.7)
5. [HUMAnN](https://github.com/biobakery/humann) (version == 3.0.0)

# Data preparation
PredCMB uses **gene families file** and **gene-metabolite interaction file** as input. The gene family file is one of the main output files generated by HUMAnN and represents the abundance of reads mapped to each gene family. Gene-metabolite interaction file is the interaction information constructed by integrating gene family, and the metabolite as results from its enzymatic reaction.  


For normalization of inter-sample depth, re-normalization is performed with copies per million (cpm) units using command provided by HUMAnN. Please refer to the human manual for details. We also screen the gene family representing the total abundance at the community level.  



 1. Re-normalization of genefamilies file to 'cpm' units

     ``$ humann_renorm_table --input /path/genefamilies.tsv --units "cpm" --output /path/genefamilies_cpm.tsv``
 
 2. Selection of the abundance of each gene family in the community

     ``$ humann_split_stratified_table --input /path/genefamilies_cpm.tsv --output /dir/``
 
 3. Conversion of gene family abundance to integer

     ``$ asinteger_genefamilies.py -i /path/dir/genefamilies_cpm_unstratified.tsv -o /path/abun_int_cpm.tsv``  



To assign uniref90 to metabolite, the mapping files of "uniref90 to ec", "uniref90 to ko" provided by the HUMAnN tool, and EC number, orthology, and reaction provided by KEGG were used as bridges. The eQuillator tool was used to determine the direction of the final product of bidirectional KEGG reaction. All of these processes are performed by running the construct_interaction.py file, which uniref_com_kerk_oc.tsv file in the interaction/database directory represents the gene-metabolite interaction file. It also provides the .rds format for easy loading from R.

```  

**Please refer to the column and row format of the input file in the example file below.**


`$SAMPLE` = Gene family abundance file in .tsv format.

## Example run ##


If you execute the command below, you perform a differential analysis of the gene abundance with experiment group based on the control group you specified. And it builds a network based on significant differential gene families and metabolite interactions, and predicts the amount of changes in metabolites based on the amount of changes in enzymatic gene families.


```
$ Rscript run_prediction.R -i genefamilies_ex.tsv -m metadata_ex.tsv -o output.tsv -r "Control" -gb interaction_ex.tsv
```

## Example output ##


The output file provides the KEGG compound identity of the predicted metabolite, the number of the enzyme gene family involved in metabolite production, the amount of change with a sign, and the p-value. It is with a significant p-value that the metabolites around which most significant microbial gene family abundance changes occur.
